The documentation page has been moved to readthedocs ([link](https://scikit-multiflow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)). Now multiple versions of the documentation are available:

- **stable** is the documentation of the latest release (default)
- **latest** is the documentation of the development version

As new versions are released, they will be kept available for reference.

The documentation for versions before `0.5.0` are only available for offline view. You can find them in the [legacy documentation](https://scikit-multiflow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/legacy-doc.html) page.
