Welcome to `scikit-multiflow`'s website.

`scikit-multiflow` is inspired by [MOA](https://moa.cms.waikato.ac.nz/), the most popular open source framework for machine learning for data streams, and [MEKA](http://meka.sourceforge.net/), an open source implementation of methods for multi-label learning. `scikit-multiflow` is also inspired on [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), the most popular framework for machine learning in Python. Following the [SciKits](https://www.scipy.org/scikits.html) philosophy, `scikit-multiflow` is an open source machine learning framework for multi-output/multi-label and stream data.

</p>

`scikit-multiflow` is implemented in Python given its increasing popularity in the Machine Learning community. It complements `scikit-learn`, whose primary focus is batch learning, expanding the set of Machine Learning tools on this platform. In its current state, `scikit-multiflow` contains stream generators, stream learning methods for multi-output/multi-target, change detectors and evaluation methods.

`scikit-multiflow` is developed by the [University of Waikato](https://www.waikato.ac.nz/), [Télécom ParisTech](https://www.telecom-paristech.fr/eng), the [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en) and the open source community.
