Welcome to `scikit-multiflow`'s website.

`scikit-multiflow` is inspired by [MOA](https://moa.cms.waikato.ac.nz/) , the most popular open source framework for data stream mining, and [MEKA](http://meka.sourceforge.net/), an open source implementation of methods for multi-label learning. `scikit-multiflow` is also inspired on [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), the most popular framework for Machine Learning. Following `scikit-learn`'s philosophy, `scikit-multiflow` is an open source framework for multi-output/multi-label and stream data mining. 

`scikit-multiflow` is implemented in Python given its increasing popularity in the Machine Learning community. It complements `scikit-learn`, whose primary focus is batch learning, expanding the set of Machine Learning tools on this platform. In its current state, `scikit-multiflow` contains stream generators, stream classifiers for multi-output/multi-target, change detectors and evaluation methods.

To start using `scikit-multiflow` please refer to [Installation](https://scikit-multiflow.github.io//installation/) for instructions to install the package on your machine. A [Qucik-Start Guide](https://scikit-multiflow.github.io//quick-start-guide/) is also available.

`scikit-multiflow` is being developed by [Télécom ParisTech](https://www.telecom-paristech.fr/eng) and [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en).

As an open source project, we welcome contributions from the community.
