**Notice:** `scikit-multiflow` works with Python 3 **only**.

`scikit-multiflow` requires `numpy` to be already installed in your system.
There are multiple ways to install `numpy`, the easiest is using
[`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/#):

``` bash
  $ pip install -U numpy
```

Once `numpy` is installed, we can proceed with the installation of
`skmulti-flow` and its other dependencies. Run the following command in the
 local path where you placed `scikit-multiflow`:

``` bash
  $ pip install -U .
```

After the installation is completed, we can start using `scikit-multiflow`.
